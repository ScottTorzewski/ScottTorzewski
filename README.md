## :man_technologist: About Me :

Welcome to my GitHub Profile! 👋
I’m Scott Torzewski, an electrical engineer with a strong interest in optoelectronics, biomedical systems, and applied photonics. I recently earned a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a Mathematics Minor from Lafayette College.

- 🔬 I’m passionate about designing and prototyping hardare systems that integrate electronics, sensors, and computational analysis to support physiological monitoring and therapeutic technologies.
- 🧬 I'm particularly interested in advancing biophotonics and bioinstrumentation through optoelectronic system design and data-driven signal processing.
- 💿 I enjoy tackling interdisciplinary challenges, translating research into real-world solutions, and continuously exploring the intersection of light-based technologies and human health.
- 💡 Outside the lab, I build 3D designs, solder electronics, play the piano, and snowboard.
